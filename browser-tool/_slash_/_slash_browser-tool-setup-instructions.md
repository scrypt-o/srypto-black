## BROWSER TOOL USAGE SUMMARY 

  We have been using the MCP of Playrite to do our testing. But we've had numerous issues with the server crashing, it being slow, and there's some safety concerns around it. 
  We have spent the time and we have created our own tool that conforms exactly to our requirements. You now have access to a fast browser testing tool that replaces slow MCP Playwright.

The tool is located in a subfolder üìÅ Tool Location: ./browser-tool/ folder in project root. 

First, please verify that this folder exists and that you can see files within this folder.  
There is no need to read all of them because it will be explained below. Your first step is just to confirm that the tool is indeed already present in this project. 

If it is not present in this project, please do the following: 

1. We hide a subfolder in the root of this project for browser-tool
2. Please copy the latest version of the tool from `/_eve_/_eve_workshop_/_custom-tools_/browser-tool/`

Once you have confirmed the tool is in üìÅ browser-tool/ folder in project root

Then

3. Read all the instructions below and setup the tool as described.
4. Please add a note to CLAUDE.md to use this tool rather than MCP Playwright by summarising the below instructions after you have confirmed you can use the tool.
