 Looking at what we've documented (folder structure + data flow), we're missing several critical patterns: the actual layout components system, authentication flow, error handling, loading states, form validation patterns, navigation/routing rules, styling
  conventions, deployment patterns, and testing approaches.
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Looking at what we've documented so far, we have:

  1. ✅ Folder Structure Pattern - Complete architecture template
  2. ✅ Data Flow Pattern - Database to frontend without wrapper hell

  What's NOT been described yet:

  3. Layout Components System

  - TileGridLayout, ItemListLayout, ItemDetailLayout implementation
  - How layouts handle different data types generically
  - Props interfaces and reusability patterns

  4. Authentication Flow Pattern

  - Login/logout flow
  - Route protection middleware
  - Auth context/hooks
  - Public vs private routes

  5. Error Handling Pattern

  - API error responses
  - Frontend error boundaries
  - User-friendly error messages
  - Error state management in TanStack Query

  6. Loading States Pattern

  - Loading skeletons
  - Suspense boundaries
  - Loading indicators
  - Optimistic updates

  7. Form Validation Pattern

  - Client-side validation with Zod
  - Server-side validation
  - Form state management
  - Error display in forms

  8. Navigation & Routing Pattern

  - Navigation config structure
  - Breadcrumbs
  - Sidebar state management
  - URL patterns and params

  9. Styling & Theming Pattern

  - Tailwind utility patterns
  - Component variant systems
  - Color schemes and branding
  - Responsive design rules

  10. State Management Pattern

  - When to use TanStack Query vs local state
  - Global state (if needed)
  - Cache invalidation strategies

  Which of these would you like me to document next? I suspect the Layout Components System might be most critical since that's what ties the architecture together.
