# Safe To Delete — Staged Legacy/Contradictory Specs

Purpose
- This folder quarantines older, superseded, or example-only materials so the main specs remain clean and authoritative. Nothing in here is consulted for current implementation decisions.

Contents
- old/: Older drafts and patterns that predate the revised approach.
- _archived/: Archived historical references, not maintained.
- v2/: Pre–revised-approach navigation/parallel patterns; superseded by current SSR-first and checklists.
- ui-examples/: Visual examples and mockups; not normative specs.

Deletion Policy
- Safe to delete anytime once you confirm no open job cards or docs link to these assets.
- If you need to reference history, prefer Git history over restoring these files into the active spec tree.

Current Canonical Locations
- Core specs and standards: ai/specs/
- Implementation guides (per-feature): ai/specs/implementation/
- Test and CI guidance: ai/specs/test-specs/

Notes
- If you find a broken link pointing here, update it to the canonical spec (usually in ai/specs/) or remove the reference if it was example-only.
