- 03 — Layout Normalization: Standardize on List/DetailPageLayout wrappers
- 04 — Cookie Setter Parity: Unify cookie `setAll` behavior across server helpers
- 05 — CSP Hardening (Prod): Strengthen Content-Security-Policy for production
- 06 — E2E Evidence: Capture Playwright MCP screenshots for shipped streams
