Diagnose MCP servers and run smoke tests

1) List MCP servers
"List available MCP servers and their tools. Confirm 'supabase-scrypto' and 'playwright' are online."

2) Supabase SQL smoke
"Using Supabase MCP, run: SELECT 1 AS ok; Return rows."

3) Supabase view-read (optional, RLS aware)
"Using Supabase MCP, run: SELECT * FROM v_patient__medhist__allergies LIMIT 1; Return rows (expect empty if no session)."

4) Playwright screenshot
"With Playwright MCP, navigate to https://qa.scrypto.online, wait for network idle, then capture a full-page screenshot and return it."
