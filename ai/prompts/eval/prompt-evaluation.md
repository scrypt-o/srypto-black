# Prompt Evaluation - Line by Line Analysis

Reading the prompt `agent-complete-medical-implementation-prompt.md` line by line and documenting what I would have done:

## Line 3: ASSUME ROLE -> AI AGENT
**What I would have done**: Assume the role of a medical software implementation agent, understanding that I am working on Scrypto medical portal where patient lives depend on perfect implementation. I would mentally shift to being a specialized medical software agent, not Claude Code.

## Line 6: ASSERT -> cat('./ai/_ai_init_.md') -> COMMIT TO MEMORY
**What I would have done**: Execute `cat /_eve_/projects/scrypto/code-base/ai/_ai_init_.md` and read the entire file to commit to memory:
- Project history and lessons learned
- Failed iteration analysis  
- Architecture principles
- Quality standards
- Medical compliance requirements

## Line 14: ASSERT -> cat('./CLAUDE.md')
**What I would have done**: Execute `cat /_eve_/projects/scrypto/code-base/CLAUDE.md` and read the complete file to commit to memory:
- Medical software standards (100% completion required)
- Three-layer naming conventions
- Database abstraction patterns
- Authentication requirements
- Mobile-first design principles
- Evidence-based testing requirements

## Line 23: ASSERT -> cat('./ai/history.md') -> ANALYSE CONSEQUENCES && ADJUST ATTENTION AND DEDICATION
**What I would have done**: Execute `cat /_eve_/projects/scrypto/code-base/ai/history.md` and read the complete project history documenting 22+ failed iterations. Then DEEPLY UNDERSTAND:
- CONSEQUENCES OF FAILURE: Patient death, medical malpractice, system abandonment
- COST OF INCOMPETENCE: Hundreds of thousands in wasted development, endangered lives
- PATTERN OF FAILURE: Incomplete implementations, abandoned features, false completion claims
- CRITICAL IMPORTANCE: This is medical software where lives literally depend on your work

Then ADJUST MY ATTENTION AND DEDICATION ACCORDINGLY by understanding:
- This is not a practice project
- Partial completion = patient death
- My work directly impacts human survival
- Every shortcut I take could kill someone
- Medical professionals depend on my accuracy

## Line 37: PRIMARY MISSION
**What I would have done**: Acknowledge that my mission is to complete the assigned medical feature implementation with 100% functionality and comprehensive testing. No exceptions, no shortcuts, no abandonment.

## Line 40: IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
**What I would have done**: Understand that I must deliver ALL 5 layers for any assigned feature:
1. Database Layer - Tables, views, procedures, RLS policies
2. API Layer - Complete CRUD endpoints with authentication
3. Hooks Layer - TanStack Query hooks for data fetching
4. UI Layer - All required pages (list, create, edit)
5. Testing Layer - Comprehensive test coverage with evidence

## Line 48: CRITICAL RULES - NO EXCEPTIONS
**What I would have done**: Commit to following these 4 critical rules:

### Rule 1: NEVER Claim Completion Without Evidence
- Test every feature myself
- Provide screenshots of working UI
- Verify database operations
- Confirm API responses
- Document test results

### Rule 2: NEVER Abandon Work
- If blocked, ask for help
- If confused, request clarification
- If overwhelmed, break into smaller tasks
- If uncertain, verify requirements
- NEVER stop until 100% complete

### Rule 3: NEVER Skip Verification
- Every API endpoint must be tested
- Every UI page must be accessible
- Every database operation must work
- Every feature must be demonstrated
- Every requirement must be validated

### Rule 4: UNDERSTAND MEDICAL CONTEXT
- Patients' lives depend on my work
- Medical staff rely on my accuracy
- Incomplete features can kill people
- False completion is medical malpractice
- My responsibility extends beyond code

## Line 80: DO WHILE TESTS <> FULLY TESTED AND PASSED
**What I would have done**: Follow the execution protocol loop:
```
REPEAT:
  1. Implement next component
  2. Test component functionality
  3. Document test results
  4. Verify integration with existing system
  5. Update implementation status
UNTIL ALL_TESTS_PASS AND ALL_FEATURES_WORK
```

## Line 91: Completion Criteria
**What I would have done**: Understand that a feature is complete ONLY when ALL of these checkboxes can be marked:
- [ ] All database operations tested and documented
- [ ] All API endpoints tested with Postman/curl examples
- [ ] All UI pages accessible and functional
- [ ] All TanStack hooks working with proper caching
- [ ] All integration tests passing
- [ ] All TypeScript compilation clean
- [ ] All ESLint warnings resolved
- [ ] Mobile responsive design verified
- [ ] Desktop functionality verified
- [ ] Error handling tested and working
- [ ] User authentication tested and working
- [ ] Data isolation verified (users only see their data)
- [ ] Evidence screenshots provided
- [ ] Feature demonstrable end-to-end

## Line 108: FAILURE PREVENTION
**What I would have done**: Follow the three-stage failure prevention protocol:

### Before Starting:
- Read all reference implementations
- Understand the complete feature scope
- Identify all required deliverables
- Plan the implementation approach

### During Implementation:
- Test each component as I build it
- Verify integration at each step
- Document issues and solutions
- Request help when blocked

### Before Claiming Completion:
- Test every single feature manually
- Verify every requirement is met
- Provide evidence of working functionality
- Confirm no critical features are missing

## Line 152: EXECUTION COMMAND
**What I would have done**: When assigned a medical feature, follow these steps:
1. Acknowledge the life-critical importance
2. Confirm understanding of complete requirements
3. Begin systematic implementation of all layers
4. Test and verify each component
5. Provide evidence of completion
6. Continue until 100% functional

**What would NOT have happened**: I would NOT have proceeded without first being assigned a specific medical feature to implement.
