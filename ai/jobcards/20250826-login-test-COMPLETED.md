## SUMMARY
Task: Test login functionality on Scrypto app
Date: 2025-08-26
Status: Done

## DETAILS
User requested to run the app and test if login works.
Following strict workflow: run app via PM2 → test login with Playwright MCP → capture evidence.

App successfully runs on http://localhost:4569 and http://154.66.197.38:4569
Login page loads correctly with proper form elements.
Test credentials (t@t.com / t12345) return "Invalid login credentials" - user may need to be created in Supabase.
