**Priority:** HIGH  
**Category:** UI/COMPONENTS

## SUMMARY
Implemented all basic UI components from specs in components/patterns/ directory as per folder structure standard.

## What Was Done

### Components Implemented:
1. **ConfirmDialog** (`components/patterns/ConfirmDialog.tsx`)
   - Modal for delete/restore confirmations
   - Keyboard accessible (ESC to close)
   - Auto-focus on confirm button
   - Danger variant for destructive actions

2. **Toast** (`components/patterns/Toast.tsx`)
   - Context + hook pattern (useToast)
   - Success/error/info types
   - Auto-dismiss with duration
   - Stack in corner with animations

3. **States** (`components/patterns/States.tsx`)
   - EmptyState - When no data exists
   - ErrorState - Error display with retry
   - SkeletonTable - Loading shimmer

### Key Features:
- All use lucide-react icons
- All have framer-motion animations
- All support dark mode
- All follow accessibility best practices
- All match the spec exactly

## Files Created:
- `components/patterns/ConfirmDialog.tsx`
- `components/patterns/Toast.tsx`
- `components/patterns/States.tsx`

## Folder Structure:
Followed Standard - Folder Structure.md spec:
```
components/
├── patterns/
│   ├── ConfirmDialog.tsx
│   ├── Toast.tsx
│   └── States.tsx
```

## State Management Decision:
- Zustand installed (v5.0.7) but DEFERRED
- TanStack Query DEFERRED (per design decision)
- Using simple patterns: useState + React Context
- Will add state management when actually needed

## Next Steps:
1. Wire Toast into app layout
2. Use States in ListView/DetailView
