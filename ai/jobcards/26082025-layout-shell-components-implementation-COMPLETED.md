# Job Card: Layout Shell Components Implementation
**Date:** 26/08/2025  
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Category:** LAYOUTS/ARCHITECTURE

## SUMMARY
Implemented the layout shell architecture components (PatientSidebar, AppHeader, BottomBar, AppShell) following bulletproof specifications to prevent layout disasters.

## What Was Done

### Components Implemented:
1. **PatientSidebar** (`components/nav/PatientSidebar.tsx`)
   - Renamed from NavSidebar for clarity (will have AdminSidebar later)
   - Collapsible groups, mobile drawer support
   - Uses correct auth with `useAuth()` and `signOut()`

2. **AppHeader** (`components/layouts/AppHeader.tsx`)
   - Fixed height (56px mobile, 64px desktop)
   - Search, notifications, user menu
   - All text truncates with safety classes

3. **BottomBar** (`components/layouts/BottomBar.tsx`) 
   - Fixed height with iOS safe areas
   - Tab navigation with 44px touch targets
   - Optional FAB center button

4. **AppShell** (`components/layouts/AppShell.tsx`)
   - Master container that controls everything
   - Locks body scroll on mount
   - Handles iOS viewport changes
   - Enforces strict parent-child hierarchy

### Key Features:
- All use lucide-react icons consistently
- All have framer-motion support with motion prop
- All use clsx for class management
- All support flat/elevated/glass styles
- Full dark mode support
- Bulletproof overflow containment

## Files Created/Modified:
- `components/nav/PatientSidebar.tsx` - Created from spec
- `components/layouts/AppHeader.tsx` - Created from spec
- `components/layouts/BottomBar.tsx` - Created from spec  
- `components/layouts/AppShell.tsx` - Created from spec

## References:
- Specs in `/ai/specs/Layout - *.md`
- Folder structure spec confirms layouts go in `components/layouts/`

## What's Still Missing:

### Basic Components (Not Started):
- ConfirmDialog (delete confirmations)
- Toast (notifications)
- EmptyState, ErrorState, LoadingState

### Composed Layouts (Not Started):
- ListPageLayout (AppShell + Sidebar + ListView)
- TilePageLayout (AppShell + Sidebar + TileGrid)  
- DetailPageLayout (AppShell + Sidebar + DetailView)

### Features (Not Started):
- No actual medical features (allergies, etc.)
- No Zod schemas
- No TanStack Query hooks

## Next Steps:
1. Create components/patterns/ directory
2. Implement basic components (Dialog, Toast, States)
3. Create composed layouts
4. Start implementing actual medical features
