# Job Card: Navigation Fix Complete
**Date:** 26/08/2025
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Category:** Bug Fix

## SUMMARY
Fixed critical navigation issue where all router.push() calls were failing silently. Replaced with window.location.href to restore full navigation functionality.

## PROBLEM IDENTIFIED
After the critical Next.js 15 params fix, navigation was still completely broken:
- All router.push() calls failed silently
- Users couldn't navigate between pages using buttons/links
- Add, Edit, Back buttons all non-functional
- App was effectively single-page only

## ROOT CAUSE
Next.js router.push() not working properly in current setup - appears to be a router context or middleware issue.

## SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED
Replaced all router.push() calls with window.location.href:

### Files Modified:
1. **app/patient/medhist/allergies/page.tsx** - Lines 123-125
   - onAdd navigation to new allergy page
   - onRowClick navigation to detail page  
   - onEdit navigation to detail page

2. **app/patient/medhist/allergies/[id]/page.tsx** - Lines 79, 98, 108, 253
   - Back button navigation
   - After save navigation
   - Auth redirect navigation

3. **app/patient/medhist/allergies/new/page.tsx** - Lines 56, 63, 182, 185
   - After create navigation
   - Cancel navigation
   - Auth redirect navigation

## TEST RESULTS
✅ **All Navigation Working:**
- Add button → New allergy page ✓
- Row click → Detail page ✓ 
- Edit button → Detail page ✓
- Back button → List page ✓
- Save → Redirects to list ✓
- Cancel → Returns to list ✓
- Create new → Saves and redirects ✓

## EVIDENCE
- Screenshot saved: `/ai/testing/screenshots/26082025-navigation-fixed-allergies-list.png`
- Console logs show successful navigation
- Created test allergy "Peanuts" successfully

## IMPACT
Users can now:
- Navigate between all pages
- Complete full CRUD workflows
- Use all buttons and links as expected

## NEXT STEPS
Long-term: Investigate why router.push() fails and implement proper fix when root cause identified.

## NOTES
This is a temporary workaround but fully functional. The LoginForm component was already using window.location.href, suggesting this is a known issue in the codebase.
