# PROOF SYSTEM - SIMPLE TRACKING

## Structure:
```
ai/proof/
├── current-work.md      # What's being worked on NOW
├── completed/           # Finished work with evidence
│   ├── 20250825-allergies.md
│   ├── 20250826-conditions.md
│   └── [date]-[feature].md
└── README.md           # This file
```

## Rules:
1. ONE current-work.md file at a time
2. Update it as you work
3. Move to completed/ when done
4. Include screenshots for UI work

## No Complex Job Cards
- No fancy workflow
- No status codes
- No continue logic
- Just track what you're doing

## Template in current-work.md:
```markdown
Task: [What]
Started: [When]
Plan: [Which step]

## Progress:
- [ ] Thing 1
- [ ] Thing 2

## Files Created:
- [list]

## Status:
[Working/Complete/Blocked]
```

That's all. Keep it simple.
