## üéØ Validation Rules

### Required Headers
- Must have `# Title` as first line
- Must have `## STATS` section
- Must have `## DATA` section

### Stat Block Rules
- One stat per line: `|stat-name="...";stat-type="...";stat-source="..."|`
- Supported types: `count`, `percentage`, `pie`, `progress`
- Column references: `col-1`, `col-2`, etc. (1-indexed)
- Multiple columns: `col-5,col-6,col-7`

### Data Table Rules
- First row = headers (no special formatting)
- All other rows = data with color codes
- Consistent column count across all rows
- Use `N/A` for not applicable fields

### Color Codes
- `@green` = Success/Complete
- `@red` = Failed/Incomplete  
- `@orange` = Partial/In Progress
- `@blue` = Information/Ongoing
- `#hexcode` = Custom color

## üìã Renderer Requirements

The renderer must:
1. **Parse sections automatically** (no AI needed)
2. **Generate stat blocks** from definitions
3. **Apply color formatting** from @color codes
4. **Handle N/A values** gracefully
5. **Work with any data** following this format
