## SUMMARY
Comprehensive verification of Scrypto implementation across **multiple verification methods**:

**Verification Types:**
- 🔧 **File Structure**: Component, API, schema, and hook existence
- 🌐 **API Endpoints**: Response codes and functionality testing  
- 🎭 **End-to-End**: Real browser testing with Playwright
- 📝 **Code Quality**: TypeScript compilation and standards compliance

**Key Findings:**
- Patient portal foundation is solid with working medical history features
- Pharmacy portal dual-app architecture successfully implemented
- Authentication and security patterns properly established
- Mobile responsiveness verified across both patient and pharmacy contexts

**Next Phase:**
- Connect pharmacy validation workstation to real prescription workflow
- Implement vector database for AI-powered project assistance
- Build chatbot interface for stakeholder communication
- Establish change management workflow with AI gatekeeper
