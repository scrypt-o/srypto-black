# Scrypto Intelligence & Reporting System

## 🎯 Vision

An AI-powered project intelligence system that serves as the "gatekeeper" for Scrypto development. This system provides:

- **Real-time project status** with automated verification
- **Comprehensive knowledge base** with vector embeddings
- **AI chatbot** for stakeholders, developers, and clients
- **Agentic capabilities** for code generation and impact analysis
- **Continuous compliance** with specs and standards

## 🔧 System Components

### 1. **Verification Engine**
- **File existence checks**: Routes, components, schemas, APIs
- **Endpoint testing**: API functionality and responses  
- **Page testing**: Playwright verification of UI components
- **Spec compliance**: Automated validation against specifications

### 2. **Knowledge Database**
- **Formal database**: Structured storage of specs, requirements, status
- **Vector embeddings**: Semantic search across all documentation
- **Real-time updates**: Continuous sync with codebase changes
- **Relationship mapping**: Dependencies between components and features

### 3. **AI Assistant**
- **Multi-level access**: Stakeholder, developer, client interfaces
- **Contextual responses**: Code snippets, examples, architecture guidance
- **Impact analysis**: "What happens if we change this?"
- **Code generation**: "How should we implement feature X?"

### 4. **Agentic Capabilities**
- **Automated development**: AI can generate code following specs
- **Quality assurance**: Continuous spec compliance checking
- **Documentation updates**: Auto-sync between specs and implementation
- **Change management**: Guided development with impact analysis
