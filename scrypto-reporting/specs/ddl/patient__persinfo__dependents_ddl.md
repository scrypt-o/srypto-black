## üîç VIEW DEFINITION

### View Name
```sql
v_patient__persinfo__dependents
```

### View Purpose
- User-filtered reads (WHERE user_id = auth.uid())
- RLS security boundary
- API read operations use this view ONLY
- **MASKS SENSITIVE DEPENDENT DATA** for non-owner access
- Family healthcare management

---

## üîê CONSTRAINTS & INDEXES

### Expected Constraints (business logic)
- `full_name` NOT NULL - required field
- `relationship` CHECK: IN ('child', 'spouse', 'parent', 'sibling', 'stepchild', 'adopted-child', 'ward', 'partner', 'other')
- `date_of_birth` CHECK: <= CURRENT_DATE (cannot be future date)
- Age validation for relationship type (e.g., child typically under 18/21)
- Index on (user_id, relationship) for family structure queries

---

## üéØ FILTER CONDITIONS

### For User's Dependents
```sql
WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
  AND is_active = true
```

### For Children Only
```sql
WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
  AND relationship IN ('child', 'stepchild', 'adopted-child', 'ward')
  AND is_active = true
```

### For Minor Dependents
```sql
WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
  AND date_of_birth > (CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '18 years')
  AND is_active = true
```

### For Medical Aid Dependents
```sql
WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
  AND medical_aid_number IS NOT NULL
  AND is_active = true
```
