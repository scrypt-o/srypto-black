## üîç VIEW DEFINITION

### View Name
```sql
v_patient__persinfo__medical_aid
```

### View Purpose
- User-filtered reads (WHERE user_id = auth.uid())
- RLS security boundary
- API read operations use this view ONLY
- **MASKS SENSITIVE MEMBER DATA** for non-owner access

---

## üîê CONSTRAINTS & INDEXES

### Expected Constraints (business logic)
- Unique constraint on (user_id) - one medical aid record per user
- `medical_aid_name` NOT NULL - required field
- `member_number` NOT NULL - required field
- `is_primary_member` boolean constraint
- `number_of_dependents` CHECK: >= 0

---

## üéØ FILTER CONDITIONS

### For User's Own Medical Aid
```sql
WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
```

### For Active Medical Aid
```sql
WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
  AND is_active = true
```

### For Primary Member Check
```sql
WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
  AND is_primary_member = true
```

---

## ‚úÖ VALIDATION RULES

### Required Fields
- `medical_aid_id` (auto-generated)
- `user_id` (from auth.uid())
- `medical_aid_name` (cannot be null)
- `member_number` (cannot be null)

### Sensitive Data Fields
- `member_number` - Medical aid member number (encrypt at rest)
- `policy_holder_id` - ID number of policy holder (encrypt at rest)
- `dependent_code` - Dependent identifier (encrypt at rest)
- `policy_holder_first_name` - Policy holder personal data (encrypt at rest)
- `policy_holder_last_name` - Policy holder personal data (encrypt at rest)

- GEMS

### Business Logic
- If `is_primary_member = true`: User is the main policy holder
- If `is_primary_member = false`: User is a dependent
- `dependent_code` used for dependent identification
- `number_of_dependents` tracks family size for primary members
