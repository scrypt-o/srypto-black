## SUMMARY
The patient application contains **31 features** across 8 domains. Analysis shows strong foundation with **routes and views implemented** for most features, but **API testing and Page 200 verification** need completion.

**Implementation Status:**
- ✅ **Personal Info (9 features)**: All routes/views working, emergency-contacts & dependents have full API coverage
- ✅ **Medical History (5 features)**: Complete CRUD with test coverage for allergies, conditions, immunizations, surgeries  
- ✅ **Care Network (2 features)**: Caregivers fully operational, caretakers not started
- ⚠️ **Prescriptions (3 features)**: Scan prescription working, my-prescriptions partial, medications not started
- ⚠️ **Vitality (2 features)**: Vital signs complete, hub page working
- ❌ **Communications (3 features)**: Alerts, messages, notifications - no implementation
- ❌ **Medications (3 features)**: My medications, history, adherence - awaiting development  
- ❌ **Lab Results (1 feature)**: View results - planned for future
- ❌ **Location/Deals/Rewards (5 features)**: Enhancement features for later phases

**Key Blockers:** Page 200 testing incomplete, TanStack integration selective, API test coverage gaps for family-history and prescription save/submit flows.
